# Remain in Memory
 
You are a nomad who has been roaming the lands for decades. Ever since losing your sense of self, you've been traveling far and wide in a vain attempt to reclaim who you once were.

Eventually, your travels bring you upon the remains of a once grand kingdom, now fallen to near ruin, barely holding onto itself by a thread. By some mysterious twist of fate, the lands of this kingdom start to bring back the shards of your past, whether you like it or not. Not only that, but as you slowly come to terms with yourself, time restores itself to a new divergence, presently lands ever-growing in sync with your state of mind.

Can you overcome your dark past, or regress to your nefarious ways?
